                  <br />
                  The main goal of virtualization is to manage workloads by

                  Firewall:
                  <br />
                  A firewall is software/hardware used to maintain the security
                  of a private network. Firewalls block unauthorized access to
                  or from private networks and are often employed to prevent
                  unauthorized Web users or illicit software from gaining access
                  to private networks connected to the Internet. A firewall may
                  be implemented using hardware, software, or a combination of
                  both.
                  <br />
                  A firewall is recognized as the first line of defense in
                  securing sensitive information. For better safety, the data
                  can be encrypted.

            <h4>Industrial Switching</h4>
            <p>
              Industrial Ethernet (IE) is the use of Ethernet in an industrial
              environment with protocols that provide determinism and real-time
              control Pro. tocols for Industrial Ethernet include EtherCAT,
              EtherNet/IP, PROFINET, POWERLINK, SERCOS III, CC-Link IE, and
              Modbus/TCP. Many Industrial Ethernet protocols use a modified MAC
              (Media Access Control) layer to provide low latency and
              determinism. Some microcontrollers such as Sitara provide
              Industrial Ethernet support. Industrial Ethernet can also refer to
              the use of standard Ethernet protocols with rugged connectors and
              extended temperature switches in an industrial environment, for
              automation or process control. Components used in plant process
              areas must be designed to work in harsh environments of
              temperature extremes, humidity, and vibration that exceed the
              ranges for information technology equipment intended for
              installation in controlled environments. The use of fiber Ethernet
              reduces the problems of electrical noise and provides electrical
              isolation to prevent equipment damage. Some industrial networks
              emphasized deterministic delivery of transmitted data, whereas
              Ethernet used collision detection which made transport time for
              individual data packets difficult to estimate with increasing
              network traffic. Typically, industrial uses of Ethernet employ
              full-duplex standards and other methods so that collisions do not
              unacceptably influence transmission times.

            <h4>WAN Optimization</h4>
            <p>
              WAN optimization is an important part of network management, as it
              allows you to prioritize traffic and guarantee a certain amount of
              available bandwidth for the most critical applications. Through
              WAN Optimization, you will be able to shape traffic, eliminate
              redundant data, compress data, cache data and manage bandwidth or
              quality of service.

            <h4>Microwave</h4>
            <p>
              Microwaves are widely used for point-to-point communications
              because their small wavelength allows conveniently-sized antennas
              to direct them in narrow beams, which can be pointed directly at
              the receiving antenna. This allows nearby microwave equipment to
              use the same frequencies without interfering with each other, as
              lower frequency radio waves do. Another advantage is that the high
              frequency of microwaves gives the microwave band a very large
              information-carrying capacity; the microwave band has a bandwidth
              30 times that of all the rest of the radio spectrum below it.{" "}

            <h4>WiMax , Pre-WiMAX</h4>
            <p>
              WiMAX, Pre-WiMAX can provide at-home or mobile Internet access
              across whole cities or countries. In many cases this has resulted
              in competition in markets which typically only had access through
              an existing incumbent DSL (or similar) operator.
            </p>
            <h4>VHF/UHF</h4>
            <p>
              VHF (Very high frequency) is the radio frequency range from 30 MHz
              to 300 MHz. Currently VHF is at the low-end of practical frequency
              usage
              <br />
              While UHF (Ultra high frequency) designates a range of
              electromagnetic waves with frequencies between 300 MHz and 3 GHz
              <br />
              Both are working for transferring voice and small data over long
              distance.
            </p>
