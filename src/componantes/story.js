            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>
              We, at ADVENT, believe, beyond any doubt, that our success, growth
              and reputation depend upon the commitment and capabilities of our
              employees as well as our leaders at every level. Having one shared
              vision and one shared purpose binds our efforts, challenges our
              capabilities and provides us with sharp focus and understanding of
              what we aspire to achieve on a group level.
              <br />
              Yet, focus alone is not enough. It is the means as well as the
              end. Our sharp focus needs to be crowned with standards of
              behavior, principles, that guide our efforts as well as guide our
              individual decisions, both on a daily level as well as on a
              strategic level, that are congruent with and supportive to the
              company's vision and objectives. ADVENT is growing in size and
              thus in responsibility towards all stakeholders including its
              employees, customers, suppliers, shareholders as well as society
              and environment. It is becoming of crucial importance to act with
              the energy, coherence and spirit of highly ethical top performing
              teams.We, at ADVENT are determined to be an exemplary company
              performing with full power fueled by committed members who believe
              that ADVENT is not only a place to work in but rather a place
              where they can fulfill their ambitions and live like a big caring
              family. It is our intention and only choice to achieve sustained
              success, through leadership, only to savor a better status to all
              stakeholders including, as a priority, the communities we work
              within.
              <br />
              To achieve that, we have together chosen to act and behave based
              on the following:

              expects everyone in the organization to behave…. the purpose of
              establishing a set of values is to create a code of behavior that
              builds a cohesive culture and supports the vision and mission.
